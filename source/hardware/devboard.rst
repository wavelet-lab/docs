======================
Development Board
======================

The development board is intended for developers and advanced users. It features USB Type-C connectors and can be connected to a computer via a PCIe x4 slot

Features
--------

* Simple Radio Frontend: Facilitates prototyping in the 2.4-GHz ISM band
* Cellular Band Duplexer: Supports common cellular frequency bands.
* Enhanced TRX Power
* Improved RX Sensitivity
* Extended Automatic Gain Control (AGC)
* Precision Clock Synchronization: Synchronization via a GNSS module.
* Mounting Options: Includes mounting holes for a heatsink or enclosure.

Installation
------------

The development board comes with a factory setup after testing.
To use the full potential of the board, some cable re-routing needs to be applied.

* Plug in the uSDR using a thin thermal interface in between.
* Gently unplug the cables from connectors J20 and J19.

* Use your MHF4 - MHF4 jumpers to connect the uSDR RX/TX to J20 and J19.
* The two available SMA cables can be plugged into the uSDR HF connector and the 1PPS connector (see the picture).

* Apply a thicker thermal interface (2.0 mm) and the heatsink as described in the :doc:`/guides/heatsink` chapter.
* Here is the final SMA schematic on the panel.

.. note::

    If you donâ€™t need to use the development board,
    you can route SMA cables directly to the uSDR connectors in the order you want.
