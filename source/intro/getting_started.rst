Getting Started with the WebSDR Platform
========================================

1. Introduction
---------------

The WebSDR platform is designed to provide a seamless Software-Defined Radio (SDR) experience for both engineers and beginners. It eliminates the complexity of setting up SDR software by offering a plug-and-play, web-based environment. Users can effortlessly perform digital signal processing (DSP) via the web, leveraging the power of cloud computing for enhanced flexibility and scalability.

**Key Advantages:**

- **Effortless setup:** No drivers or manual installation requiredâ€”just connect and start.
- **Cloud-based processing:** Run applications remotely, store settings, and replicate configurations with ease.
- **Cross-platform compatibility:** Access from Linux, Windows, and macOS.
- **Scalable infrastructure:** Connect multiple uSDR devices as needed.
- **Collaboration-ready:** Share signals, stream raw IQ data, and work with others globally.

2. Core Features
----------------

2.1 Cloud-Optimized Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Efficient CPU usage:** Applications can run in the cloud, reducing local processing demands.
- **Scalable infrastructure:** Connect multiple uSDRs dynamically to expand your setup.
- **Ready-to-use SDR applications:** Pre-installed tools allow users to get started instantly.
- **Personalized workspace:** Store settings, configurations, and workflows securely in the cloud.
- **Custom application development:** Build, port, and share custom SDR applications with the community.

2.2 Collaborative Signal Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The WebSDR platform enables global collaboration and signal sharing, making SDR more accessible and interactive.

- **Device sharing:** Multiple users can access the same uSDR device simultaneously, running different applications in parallel.
- **Data stream routing:** Collect and process data from different SDR sources in a single location.
- **Remote signal processing:** Share signals with others or stream raw IQ data for real-time global processing.

3. Getting Started
------------------

**Step 1: Connect Your uSDR**

- Plug in the uSDR device to the host system.
- Ensure network connectivity for cloud-based features.

**Step 2: Access the WebSDR Platform**
